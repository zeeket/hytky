# HYTKY

![Playwright tests](https://github.com/zeeket/hytky/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)

Site and forum for a student organization centered around electronic music culture. This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
The forum login is designed to be exclusive to members of certain Telegram groups. A Telegram user's membership status in the groups is checked with [HYTKYbot](https://github.com/zeeket/HYTKYbot).

## Running

### Requirements
- Docker Compose
- Make

### Instructions

1. `git clone <this repo>`
2. `cd hytky`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and put your secret values in the `.env` file.
4. `cp .hytkybot.env.example .hytkybot.env` and put your secret values in the `.hytkybot.env` file.
5. `make dev` for hot reloading **or** `make prod` for a production-like environment.
    - Production environments should be seeded manually with `make seed`

### Making changes to the database
In a development environment, use the `make migrate` command to generate and apply migrations.
Commit the following to source control:
- The entire migration history folder
- The schema.prisma file

## Deployment

The username of the Telegram bot that is used for the Telegram login button on the login page is stored as a variable on this GitHub repo. This is because we want to serve the login page with SSG from the container.
To change the value to point to your own [HYTKYbot](https://github.com/zeeket/HYTKYbot):
1. Fork this repo.  
2. Add the NEXT_PUBLIC_TG_BOT_NAME variable containing your bot's username to your forked repository.  
3. Edit [docker/docker-compose.prod.from-registry.yml](docker/docker-compose.prod.from-registry.yml) to point to your GHCR.

You should then be able to fetch the latest working image from your GHCR and simulate a deployment locally with `make regprod`

### Deployment requirements
  - [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) & access to a x86_64 `apt` based Linux production server

### Initial deployment instructions
Replace 123.123.123.123 with your server's IP. Makefile asssumes you authenticate with `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  1. `make testconnect IP=123.123.123.123` should succeed
  2. `make prepareprod IP=123.123.123.123`
  3. `make startprod IP=123.123.123.123`
  
### Continuous delivery
To push a new image, `git tag` a commit on the main branch with a semantic version number (for example `v1.0.0`).
Latest image should get picked up by [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/).

## TODO
- Allow image submissions to posts and store them in minio (S3).
- use Watchtower to deploy production Docker image.
- English language option for all pages.
- Seed db from JSON if `prisma/eventArchive.json` or `prisma/forumArchive.json` exist.  
- Remotely back up a deployment's database to `prisma/forumBackup.json` with a command.
- Use src/server/utis/validators
- Use toasts
